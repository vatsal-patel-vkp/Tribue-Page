                        <li>1. On June 14, 2020, Rajput, matured 34, was discovered dead, swinging from the roof fan in 
                            his home in Bandra, Mumbai.</li>
                        <li>2. He had allegedly given indications of clinical sadness and was experiencing bipolar confusion.</li>
                        <li>3. The post-mortem report described that the reason for death was "asphyxia because of hanging" and considered 
                            it an "unmistakable instance of suicide."</li>
                        <li>4. The dissection specialists set the hour of death at 10 to 12 hours before a posthumous assessment on 
                            June 14 at 11:30 p.m.— which means between 11:30 a.m. what's more, 1:30 p.m. (Indian Standard Time). 
                            The viscera report in like manner precluded unfairness.</li>
                        <li>5. On July 25, Rajput's family held up a first data report with police in Patna, where his dad lives, 
                            blaming Rhea Chakraborty and five others for abetment of self-destruction.</li>
